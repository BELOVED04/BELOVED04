# BELOVED DAVID  

I build, teach, and think in long arcs.  
Code, creativity, and faith — three ways of naming the same search for meaning.  

I move with intent, not haste.  
Sometimes I write code that teaches; sometimes I teach code that awakens.  
Both are ways of tracing purpose through logic.  

### What I’m learning  
- Depth over display.  
- The cost of clarity.  
- How discipline fuels creation.  

### Ongoing themes  
Faith as architecture.  
Excellence as worship.  
Purpose as the code beneath everything.  

I’m not chasing noise.  
I’m tuning my craft toward what endures.
